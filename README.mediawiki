<dl>
<dt>I am trying to import an XML file from the iOS app. Where must I save this?</dt>
<dd>This app looks in a folder located on the SD card called <strong>rmd</strong> and the XML file should be called <strong>rmd.xml</rmd>, which is also the default name I have the iOS version save to. If neither of these requirements are met, the XML file will not be found.</dd>
